# GreenMail
PILS Project INSA Lyon

Realize a browser mail client offering a simple user experience and to encourage the removal of emails. The goal is to develop an email classification algorithm that detects 'deletable' emails and offers them to the user for simplified deletion to reduce the carbon footprint.

Our mail client would be divided into 2 main tabs: a classic reception box part where the mails are displayed chronologically and a part 'file' where the mails would be organized in an intelligent way (tree type Linux, labeling or other). The idea is to treat the mails with each connection of the user, either by canceling the 'deletable' mails or by classifying them. The classic reception box would be as empty as possible.

We would make the deletion fun by promoting the removal of mails by a reward ecofriendly (type Ecosia with trees). For example: 40 mails deleted = 1 tree planted.
